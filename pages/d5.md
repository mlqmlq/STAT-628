## SQL Tutorial

SQL, Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed to manage data stored in relational databases. SQL operates through simple, declarative statements. This keeps data accurate and secure, and helps maintain the integrity of databases, regardless of size.

## Relational database

A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables. A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns. Tables are sometimes referred to as relations. All data stored in a relational database is of a certain data type. Some of the most common data types are:

- `INTEGER`: a positive or negative whole number
- `TEXT`: a text string
- `DATE`: the date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD
- `REAL`: a decimal value

## SQLite3 in Python

### Start connect to sqlite3 server

[Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)

Python is an object-oriented language [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), you should learn the basic concept for this term.

To run our `sqlite3`, you need to first connect to a local/remote database via `.connect(NAME)`

Once you have a [Connection](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection), you can create a [Cursor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor) object and call its [execute()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.execute) method to perform SQL commands. Also, you can use `fetchall()` command to get the results. Otherwise, you are merely displaying the *representation of the method*.

```Python
# Python3
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect(NAME)
cursor_obj = conn.cursor()
cursor_obj.execute(SQL_COMMAND)
cursor_obj.fetchall()
```

### Create a TABLE

To create a `SQL TABLE`, first you need to [CREAT TABLE](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_create_table.asp), also declare columns' name and type

```sql
--SQLite3

CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);
```
In Python, if you want to run a sql command, you need to pass a string to `cursor.execute(SQL_COMMAND: string)`

```python
# Python3

command = """
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);
"""
cursor_obj.execute(command)
```

### Show tables in current database

To show tables, in sqlite3 console you can use `.tables`, more command from `.help`

```sql
--SQLite3

.tables
```

or 

```sql
--SQLite3

SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';
```

Here the `SELECT` command is select object from database, once you executing a `SELECT` statement. 

Equivalent, in python, we can do

```python
# Python3

command = "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';"
cursor_obj.execute(command)
print(cursor_obj.fetchall())
```

You can either treat the cursor as an [iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator), call the cursorâ€™s [fetchone()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.fetchone) method to retrieve a single matching row, or call [fetchall()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.fetchall) to get a list of the matching rows.

### Insert one record in database

Once we create our base table, we can start insert records into the database.

In sqlite3, it is possible to write the `INSERT INTO` statement in two ways.

The first way specifies both the column names and the values to be inserted:

```sql
--SQLite3

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

or 

```sql
--SQLite3

INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

## Relational database

Different [Key types](https://www.dotnettricks.com/learn/sqlserver/different-types-of-sql-keys)

[**Primary key**](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_primarykey.asp) is a set of one or more fields/columns of a table that uniquely identify a record in database table. It can not accept null, duplicate values. Only one Candidate Key can be Primary Key.

[**Foreign key**](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_foreignkey.asp) is a field in database table that is Primary key in another table. It can accept multiple null, duplicate values. For more help refer the article [Difference between primary key and foreign key](http://www.dotnettricks.com/learn/sqlserver/difference-between-primary-key-and-foreign-key).

**Consider if you are hiring by amazon, how did you manage amazon data? how many tables do you need, how to link them together?**

```sql
--SQLite3

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(1000)
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    price NUMERIC,
    original VARCHAR(1000)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    size INT,
    CustomerID INT, 
    ProductID INT, 
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID)
);
```

### Why?

Link TABLES together!

### Practice

In the [Assignment](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1951-a/assignments/sql.html), there is a database named people.db, with the name, age, ID, and occupation of some students. Here we can create these three tables by ourself.

```
people_main(ID INTEGER, name TEXT, occupation TEXT, age INTEGER)
people_likes(ID1 INTEGER, ID2 INTEGER)
people_friends(ID1 INTEGER, ID2 INTEGER)
```

1. Create table `people_main`, `people_likes` and `people_friends`.
2. Consider what is the primary key in `people_main`.


The table `people_likes`, based on following roles:

1. ID1 and ID2 should from people_main table
2. ID1 likes the person with ID2
3. Suppose each person can only like one person

**Should we have a key/keys for this table? If so, what type of key/keys?**

`people_friends` should based on:

1. ID1 and ID2 should from people_main table
2. ID1 != ID2
3. If person with ID1 is friend with ID2, the revers should also be true

**How about people_friends?**

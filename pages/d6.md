## Review of last week
``` python
# Python3
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect(NAME)
cursor_obj = conn.cursor()
cursor_obj.execute(SQL_COMMAND)
cursor_obj.fetchall()
```

Commonly used commands:

- **SELECT**  - extracts data from a database
- **INSERT INTO** - inserts new data into a database
- **DELETE** - deletes data from a database
- **CREATE TABLE** - creates a new table
- **AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS** - e.g. `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `SUM`...
- **GROUP BY** - groups rows that have the same values
- **JOIN** - combine rows from two or more tables
- **WITH** - give a sub-query block a name
- **UNION** - combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements
- **HAVING** - apply conditions over aggregation functions

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
```
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);
```
```sql
SELECT MIN|MAX|COUNT|AVG|SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
```sql
SELECT count(ID), occupation FROM people_main
GROUP BY occupation;
```
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
(INNER) JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```
**Different types of JOIN**

[people.db](../assets/people.db). 

It contains the name, age, ID, and occupation of some students, as well as their relationships. Here are the tables in that database. 

```
people_main(ID INTEGER, name TEXT, occupation TEXT, age INTEGER)
people_likes(ID1 INTEGER, ID2 INTEGER)
people_friends(ID1 INTEGER, ID2 INTEGER)
``` 

```
 (1, 'Pheonix Chambers', 'Chefs', 35),
 (2, 'Shaquille Mcintosh', 'Librarians', 29),
 (3, 'Lailanie Mcfarland', 'Principals', 26),
 ...
```
```
 (1, 29),
 (4, 74),
 (4, 100),
 ...
```

- Write a SQL statement to find pairs (A, B) such that person A likes person B, but A is not friends with B. Results should be ordered by ID1 (ascending), then ID2 (ascending).

*Hint: consider `left join`.*

### WITH
Often times, we want to combine two tables, but one of the tables is the result of another query. 
```sql
WITH previous_results AS (
   SELECT ...
   ...
   ...
   ...
)
SELECT *
FROM previous_results
JOIN people_main
  ON previous_results.__ = people_main.__;
```

### Exercises
- Write a SQL statement that returns the occupation and and how many people like that occupation. Results should be ordered by popularity from high to low

*Hint: First join people_main with people_likes, then run group by command with count*

- Write a SQL statement that returns the distinct name and age of all people who are liked by anyone younger than them. Results should be ordered by name (A-Z)

### UNION
The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```

### HAVING
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.

Example, if I want to know the occupations that have more than 5 people, we can write the query as
```sql
SELECT occupation, count(*) FROM people_main
GROUP BY occupation
having count(*) > 5;
```
### Exercise:
- Write a SQL statement that returns the name and occupation of all people who have more than 3 friends. 

*Consider using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `COUNT` and `HAVING`*

## Relational database

Different [Key types](https://www.dotnettricks.com/learn/sqlserver/different-types-of-sql-keys)

[**Primary key**](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_primarykey.asp) is a set of one or more fields/columns of a table that uniquely identify a record in database table. It can not accept null, duplicate values. Only one Candidate Key can be Primary Key.

[**Foreign key**](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_foreignkey.asp) is a field in database table that is Primary key in another table. It can accept multiple null, duplicate values. For more help refer the article [Difference between primary key and foreign key](http://www.dotnettricks.com/learn/sqlserver/difference-between-primary-key-and-foreign-key).

## Practice
Consider the following relational schema:

<img src="../assets/notesFigs/Computer-store-db.png" width="600"/>

PK and FK stand for primary key and foreign key respectively.

We first generate the tables using the following code:
``` python
# In Python
conn = sqlite3.connect('computer.db')
cursor_obj = conn.cursor()
cursor_obj.execute('''
CREATE TABLE Manufacturers (
	Code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	Name CHAR(50) NOT NULL 
);
''')
cursor_obj.execute('''
CREATE TABLE Products (
	Code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	Name CHAR(50) NOT NULL ,
	Price REAL NOT NULL ,
	Manufacturer INTEGER NOT NULL 
		CONSTRAINT fk_Manufacturers_Code REFERENCES Manufacturers(Code)
);
''')
cursor_obj.execute('''
INSERT INTO Manufacturers(Code,Name) VALUES (1,'Sony'),
                                    (2,'Creative Labs'),
                                    (3,'Hewlett-Packard'),
                                    (4,'Iomega'),
                                    (5,'Fujitsu'),
                                    (6,'Winchester');   
''')
cursor_obj.execute('''
INSERT INTO Products(Code,Name,Price,Manufacturer) VALUES
(1,'Hard drive',240,5),
(2,'Memory',120,6),
(3,'ZIP drive',150,4),
(4,'Floppy disk',5,6),
(5,'Monitor',240,1),
(6,'DVD drive',180,2),
(7,'CD drive',90,2),
(8,'Printer',270,3),
(9,'Toner cartridge',66,3),
(10,'DVD burner',180,2);
''')

```
Now, based on the tables created, finish the following tasks:
- Select the names and the prices of all the products in the store.
- Select the name of the products with a price less than or equal to $200.
- Select the name and price in cents (i.e., the price must be multiplied by 100).
- Compute the average price of all the products.
- Select the name and price of all products with a price larger than or equal to $180, and sort first by price (in descending order), and then by name (in ascending order).
- Select the name and price of the cheapest product.
- Select the average price of each manufacturer's products, showing the manufacturer's name.

[Solutions](../assets/notebooks/sql_practice.html)

## Interview questions:
1. Suppose we throw a fair coin. Which of the following probability is larger: (1) Throw 10 times and get 5 heads. (2) Throw 100 times and get 50 heads.

2. Suppose we do a simple linear regression without inercept: `y ~ x`. (1) Will the point estimate of $\hat\beta$ change if we duplicate the data points? (2) Will the $t$-statistic change? If it changes, what is the relationship with before?

3. Suppose we do a simple linear regression with intercept, and the sample variance of $x_i$ and $y_i$ equals to each other. Consider the following two model: $y = \hat a_1 + \hat b_1 x$; $x = \hat a_2 + \hat b_2 y$. (1) What are the relationships between $\hat b_1$ and $\hat b_2$? (2) What are the relationships between $R^2$ when we run `y ~ x` and `x ~ y`? (3) What are the relationship between $\hat b_1$, $\hat b_2$ and $R^2$?

4. Find an example such that $\text{Cor}(x_1, y) < 0.1$, $\text{Cor}(x_2, y) = 0$, but the $R^2$ for `y ~ x1 + x2` equals to 1.

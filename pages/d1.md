### Survey:

* your name
* your program, your year
* your next step? continue research or industry
* what is your favorite programming language?

### Expectations

- active participations
	- ask questions
	- try things out, spend time debugging
	- help others with their practical roadblocks

#### I will *not*:

- google things for you. For example, if you ask my _how to install jupyter notebook_, I will send you this [link](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+install+jupyter+notebook)
- teach how to use a programming language
- tell how past students do the module. You shouldn't ask for any kind of code or material also. We will check them. 

### Questions?

Some of the following contents are from Prof. Ané's [STAT 679](http://cecileane.github.io/computingtools/pages/notes0906-intro-shell.html) and [Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bourne_Shell_Scripting/Files_and_streams).

## The Unix Shell

GUI (graphical user interface): easy but not reproducible.

CLI (command line interface) or REPL (read-evaluate-print loop): steep learning curve but reproducible and powerful.

After you have a terminal open, type `echo $SHELL`.
You may see this:

```shell
$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
```

or you may get this:

```shell
% echo $SHELL
/bin/zsh
```

The terminal is the "window" (more or less), while the shell is a program
(or a programming language, like R and Python are).
There are several shell programs, `bash` (and `zsh`) being the most common.
They are almost equivalent.

### A list of shell commands

- directory structure, root is `/`
- relative versus absolute paths
  * in your code and projects: use **relative** paths as much as
    possible: it makes your code more portable, for others, and
    for yourself if you re-locate your own project folder
- shortcuts: `.`, `..`, `~`, `-`
  * `cd -` is so useful!
- tab completion to get program and file names
- up/down arrows and `!` to repeat commands

|          |      |
|:---------|:-----------|
| `whoami` | who am I? to get your username |
| `pwd`    | print working directory. where am I? |
| `ls`     | list. many options, e.g. `-a` (all) `-l` (long) `-lrt` (reverse-sorted by time) |
| `cd`     | change directory |
| `mkdir`  | make directory   |
| `rm`     | remove (forever). `-f` to force, `-i` to ask interactively, `-r` recursively
| `rmdir`  | remove (delete) directory, if empty |
| `mv`     | move (and rename). can overwrite existing files, unless `-i` to ask|
| `cp`     | copy. would also overwrite existing files |
| `touch`  | create blank file, or modify time stamp of existing file |
| `diff`   | difference |
| `wc`     | word count: lines, words, characters. `-l`, `-w`, `-c` |
| `cat`    | concatenate |
| `less`   | because "less is more". `q` to quit. |
| `sort`   | `-n` for numerical sorting |
| `head`   | first 10 lines. `-n 3` for first 3 lines (etc.) |
| `tail`   | last 10 lines. `-n 3` for last 3 lines, `-n +30` for line 30 and up |
| `uniq`   | filters out repeated lines (consecutive). `-c` to get counts |
| `cut`    | cut and return column(s). `-d,` to set the comma as field delimiter (tab otherwise), `-f2` to get 2nd field (column) |
| `echo`   | print |
| `history`| shows the history of all previous commands, numbered |
| `!`      | `!76` to re-execute command number 76 in the history, `!$` for last word or last command |

The shell is an incredibly powerful tool:

+ The Unix shell can do great things, but power comes with danger: it’s unsafe!
* [example](https://github.com/UWMadison-computingtools-master/lecture-examples/tree/master/rm-example):

```shell
$ rm -rf tmp-data/aligned-reads*
```

deletes all large alignment files `aligned-reads_1` to `aligned-reads_1000`
in old temporary directory `tmp-data`.

`rm` is to remove files & directories  
`-r` will do it recursively (enter each directory within each directory)  
`-f` will "force" removal without asking you confirmation for each individual file  
`*` in the shell will match anything

You should understand what the command is doing before executing it!

## The Unix world: one file after another

When you think of a computer, you usually come up with the following things:

+ The computer itself

+ The keyboard

+ The mouse

+ Your hard drive with your files and directories on it

+ The network connection leading to the Internet

However, everything in the whole (Unix) universe is a file. Your (data) files are files. Your directories are files. Your hard drive is a file. Your keyboard, monitor and printer are files. Your keyboard is a read-only file of infinite size. Your monitor is infinitely sized write-only files. Your network connection is a read/write file.

## Streams: what goes between files

Everything in Unix is a file -- except that which sits between files. Between files Unix defines a mechanism that allows data to move, bit by bit, from one file to another: the **stream**.

Unix has the following three standard streams:

+ **Standard in (stdin)**: the standard stream for input into a file.

+ **Standard out (stdout)**: the standard stream for output out of a file.

**Standard error (stderr)**: the standard stream for error output from a file.

### Text streams

to process a stream of data rather than holding it all in memory.

Example: concatenate two data files.
Open both in editor, copy one and paste into the other?

* may not have enough memory
* manual operation: error-prone and not reproducible.

Instead: print the files's content to *standard output* stream and
redirect this stream from our terminal to the file we wish to save the combined results to.
